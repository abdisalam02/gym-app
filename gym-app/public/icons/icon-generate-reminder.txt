PWA Icon Generation Guide

You need to generate the following PWA icon files for a complete PWA experience:

1. icon-72x72.png (72x72 pixels)
2. icon-96x96.png (96x96 pixels)
3. icon-128x128.png (128x128 pixels)
4. icon-144x144.png (144x144 pixels)
5. icon-152x152.png (152x152 pixels)
6. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
7. icon-384x384.png (384x384 pixels)
8. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
9. apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels)
10. favicon-16x16.png (16x16 pixels)
11. favicon-32x32.png (32x32 pixels)

Tools for generating PWA icons:
1. Use https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator to upload a high-quality square logo and download all the needed icons
2. Or use https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/ to generate your manifest and icons
3. For local development, you can use the Favicon Generator CLI: npm install -g cli-real-favicon

For the best results:
- Start with at least a 512x512 pixel square image of your app logo
- Ensure the image has proper padding around the edges
- Use PNG format with transparency for the best compatibility
- Make sure the icon is recognizable even at small sizes

After generating these icons, place them in the public/icons directory of your Next.js project.
